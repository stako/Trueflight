## ‚ùì FAQ

**Can I move or scale the bar?**
Yes. Positioning and scaling can be adjusted via the `/trueflight` options GUI. While test mode is enabled, positioning can also be adjusted by clicking & dragging.

**Does it work for other classes?**
No. Trueflight is tailored specifically for Hunters and their unique shot mechanics.

**Why does the Auto Shot bar stutter or reset during the cooldown period?**
This usually happens if you're using `/cast !Auto Shot` in your macros ‚Äî especially in instant cast abilities like Arcane Shot or Chimera Shot.

When you attempt to cast Auto Shot while it's still on cooldown (during its swing timer), Blizzard's ‚Äúretry timer‚Äù kicks in, delaying your next Auto Shot by up to **0.5 seconds**. This causes the bar to stutter or reset as it reflects the updated timing.

***Recommendation:***
Remove `/cast !Auto Shot` from your non-Auto Shot macros. Including Auto Shot like this is not only unnecessary in Classic ‚Äî it can actually reduce your DPS.
